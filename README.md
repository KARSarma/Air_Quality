### Air Quality Analysis Project

This project is dedicated to analyzing air quality data to uncover insights into pollution levels and their implications. Utilizing Python and the Pandas library, the project involves several key phases:

- **Data Import and Setup**: Load necessary Python libraries and set up the environment for data analysis.
- **Data Reading**: Ingest air quality data from a CSV file, ensuring the data is correctly loaded for analysis.
- **Preliminary Data Exploration**: Explore the dataset to understand its structure, including the number and type of columns, and prepare it for deeper analysis.
- **Geospatial Analysis: Analyze** the spatial distribution of air quality measurements to identify patterns and trends across different geographic areas, providing valuable insights into how air quality varies with location.

This repository contains all the code necessary for replicating the analysis, aimed at environmental scientists, data analysts, and public health researchers interested in air quality trends.
